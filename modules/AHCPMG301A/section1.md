# Weed introduction

#### Definition of a weed
The most commonly recognised definition of a weed is: "A plant growing in the wrong place at the wrong time for the wrong reasons"

The broad definition of a weed is a plant growing where it not wanted. In the last 200 years, over 28000 foreign plant species have been introduced into Australia. Most hav ebeen deliberatly imported for pasture, horiculture or onamental reasons, but some introductions have been dental. Many of these introduced plants have spread and now cause harmful impacts. Weeds cost the Australian economy over $4 billion each year; they place numerous native plant species under threat and have been implicated in the exctinction of several.

Weeds come from all plant groups * trees, shrubs, annuals, soft wooded and herbaceous perennials, grasses, sedges, rushes and aquatic plants.

To ensure agricultural chemicals are used correctly, the target weed needs to be identified correctly. All users of agricultural chemicals should have a basic understanding of weed biology so as to recognise when control measures are required and how best to implement them.

#### What is a weed?
Weeds have the ability to:
* Compete with crops, pastures, recreational areas and forestry
* Change natural ecosystems
* Harbor pests or provide an alternative host for disease
* Cause harm by way of toxic or physical treat to humans and livestock
* Induce taints in livestock products such as milk
* Induce allergies
* Create safety problems
* Block waterways and water storage areas
* Increase the management cost of public and privately owned amenities
* Interfere with essential services such as telephone and power lines
* Devalue land

#### Success of weeds
The following characteristics make weeds successful. When you review the weed collection you may add other characteristics from the specimesn collection for your situation or area.

* Characteristics that allow the species to thrive in difficult or good conditions
* Massive seed production
* Ability to regenerate quickly after damage
* Effective seed dispersal methods
* Vegetative reproduction
* Inconspicuous flowers with enable seed production before presence is observed

Increased operational costs to business are a direct result of weed infestation of production areas, crops and pastures. Reduced appearance quality and recreational value occur in ornamental gardens and sporting areas from weed presence.

Weeds compete with preferred plants for water, light nutrients and air and are often vectors for pest and disease such as viral and fungal infections. In industrial situations, rights of way and other utility areas weeds interfere with their designed use and may create unacceptable fire risks and other hazards.

Only a few weed species are native to Australia, eg. Bracket (Pteridium esculentum), the majority have been introduced by carelessness or as ornamental plants which subsequently escaped cultivation, eg. Lantama camara or Ligustrum spp. For some species, the lack of natural predators or the favorable environmental conditions have contributed to their success as weeds.

Modern agricultural methods, such as monocultures, contribute to weed invasion where crops are grown in rows leaving gaps allowing colonization by weed species. Crops are generally grown in single species stands that tend not fully exploit the habitat.
