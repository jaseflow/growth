### Introduction
Some jobs can be dangerous. Workers who face potential injury on the job often have to use protective equipment. Construction workers wear hard hats to protect their heads from falling debris. Police officers put on bulletproof vests to protect their bodies when they go places they can possibly be shot. Chemists wear goggles when working with certain chemicals that can dentally splash in their eyes.

### What is PPE?
PPE stands for personal protective equipment. This equipment is used to protect healthcare workers and prevent the spread of germs to others. The equipment is personal because it's used individually and not shared with others. Most of them are thrown away after being used one time. They are protective because the equipment works as a barrier between the body and the germs. Gloves, gowns and masks are the most common pieces of equipment used. Other ones includes goggles, respirators, and head and shoe coverings.
### Types of PPE
Let's first start talking about the **three G's -- gloves, gowns and goggles.**

**Gloves** are worn to protect your hands when handling dirty items and potentially touching body fluids. This is the number one PPE you will use a lot in a healthcare environment. 

**Gowns** are worn over your clothes and uniforms. Germs can even live on them and be transferred other places. Gowns can keep you clean when you are exposed to body fluids and dirty items. 

**Goggles** protect your eyes from the body fluids that can potentially splash in your eyes.
